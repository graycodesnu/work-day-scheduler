# Work Day Scheduler 

## Introduction
This project is a result of our bootcamp's week 5 homework assignment. Students were expected to create a schedule using starter code, which would display the current date, working hours, be edited to add and save events to local storage. The project can be found [here](https://graycodesnu.github.io/work-day-scheduler/).

## Goals
The goal of this assignment was to create a user-friendly calendar app. More details are below: 

+ The current date would be displayed as a header at the top of the calendar
+ The user would scroll down and be presented with color-coded time blocks relative to the current hour
+ Said time blocks allowed for input to be entered as a new event
+ New events added to time blocks can be saved to local storage 
+ Saved events would persist after refreshing the page

## Results
I found this project to be extremely difficult, which was likely a result of my use of JavaScript instead of jQuery throughout. Initially, the setup and formatting of the project came to me easily and is probably the most successful part of this project. 

The Bootstrap portion of this project was much more enjoyable than the rest of it. Initially, I was also able to use moment.js to create the date header, however, as I continued to write my code, the header was no longer appending to the page.

I was successful in creating formatted time blocks allowing for user input, however, I failed to successfully complete the other points of the project. Again, my hunch is that this is a result of my use of JavaScript instead of jQuery, but I am unsure where I went wrong. I have spent an exorbitant amount of time attempting to debug this project, but I have not been able to fix it, despite my attempt to leverage code from several of our class exercises and online resources. Rather than starting over completely using jQuery, I have resigned to submitting this half-done project with the code I do have, in hopes that I will receive some useful feedback with which I can point myself in the right direction.
